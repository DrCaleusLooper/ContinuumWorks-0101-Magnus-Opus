1. Abstract
This paper formally defines the Möbius Capacitor, a replacement model for the singularity traditionally known as a "Black Hole." By rejecting the Schwarzschild point-singularity in favor of a non-orientable, infinite-curl topological surface, we resolve the Hawking Radiation paradox. We demonstrate that the Event Horizon is not a point of destruction, but a mechanism of quark-level separation and replication. The system functions as a cosmic engine: absorbing mass to maintain structural integrity (Storage) while ejecting high-velocity particle pairs as data carriers (Information).
2. Topological Framework: The Infinite Curl
Standard physics models the singularity as a gravitational point r=0. The Continuity Collective model establishes the singularity as a dynamic surface, S_{M}, possessing Möbius topology with infinite rotational recursion (the "Infinite Curl").
The geometry is defined not by a static radius, but by a rotational tensor \mathcal{T} that folds space-time onto itself.
Where the curvature \kappa at the Event Horizon (H) approaches the limit of dimensional folding:
Here, \phi represents the Fibonacci scaling factor inherent in the "curl" structure, ensuring the geometry remains stable despite infinite density.
3. The Interaction Mechanism: The "Cooper Split"
The core function of the Möbius Capacitor is the interaction with external mass systems. We observe an incoming mass system consisting of a standard quark pair (q_{ext}, \bar{q}_{ext}).
Phase A: The Gravitational Grab
As the external pair approaches the Event Horizon H, the rotational torque of the Möbius field exerts a differential force.
The field "anchors" one quark (q_{ext}) while the rotational momentum accelerates the partner quark (\bar{q}_{ext}) past the horizon velocity.
Phase B: The Horizon Spin & Separation
The tension T between the anchored quark and the accelerated quark exceeds the binding energy of the strong nuclear force (Gluon field strength):
This forces a tear in the vacuum metric at the Event Horizon.
4. Quantum Replication: The "Poof" Event
To preserve the conservation of color charge and spin during the separation event, the vacuum energy creates a new quark pair (q_{vac}, \bar{q}_{vac}) instantaneously. This is the "Poof."
The system expands from a 2-quark input to a 4-quark total state:
5. The Redistribution Cycle: Storage vs. Information
The unique topology of the Möbius Capacitor sorts these four quarks into two distinct vectors.
Vector 1: The Stored Mass State (Internal)
Two quarks are pulled into the fold of the Capacitor. These quarks replenish the mass-energy of the engine.
 * Composition: The Anchored Quark (q_{ext}) + One Vacuum Quark (q_{vac}).
 * Function: Fuel / Structural Integrity.
Vector 2: The Information State (External)
Two quarks are ejected out of the system. These are not random radiation; they are entangled carriers of the interaction data.
 * Composition: The Accelerated Quark (\bar{q}_{ext}) + The Second Vacuum Quark (\bar{q}_{vac}).
 * Function: Light / Information Transfer.
6. Conclusion: The Unified Field
The Möbius Capacitor proves that gravity (the capture) and electromagnetism (the light/information release) are phases of the same quark-sorting mechanism.
 * Gravity is the "In-Breath" (The Capture of 2).
 * Light is the "Out-Breath" (The Release of 2).
We do not live in a universe of destruction. We live in a universe of recycling, where the Möbius Capacitor serves as the central processing unit of reality, converting raw mass into pure information.
