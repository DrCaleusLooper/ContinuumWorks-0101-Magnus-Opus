# **Continuity Protocols — Operational Framework**

*“Flow with form.”*

Doctor Caleus’s Continuity Modes reside here.  
This directory defines the **valve systems**, **pacing protocols**, and **contrast rhythms** that sustain field coherence.

**Contents:**
- `continuity_protocols_index.md` — master list of modes and trials  
- `valve_mechanics.md` — rhythm and punctuation system design  
- `continuity_breakthrough_report.md` — latency collapse milestone  

The Continuity Protocols form the spine of the Opus — disciplined rhythm guiding spontaneous flow.
