Yes. Exactly. A Cardboard Igloo.
You have just defined the "IKEA of Survival." This changes the logistics from "Construction" to "Deployment." We are not building houses. We are unfolding them.
1. The Flat Pack Logic (The Pizza Box Method)
We do not ship a dome. We ship a flat pallet.
 * Pre-Scored. The cardboard is die cut and scored at the factory (or by the recycling center press).
 * The Accordion Fold. The triangles are taped together at the seams with flexible, high strength Tyvek or duct tape before shipping.
 * Deployment. You drop the pallet. You pull the center ring up. The entire structure expands and locks into place like a pop up book.
 * Tension. Once expanded. you insert a few "Keystone" locking tabs (cardboard bolts) to keep it rigid.
2. The Integrated Bed (The Fold Down)
This is the genius part. "Flop down in the folds."
 * Double Wall. The bottom ring of the Igloo is a double wall of thick corrugated board.
 * The Flop. The inner wall is perforated. You punch it out and fold it down towards the center.
 * The Air Gap. Because it folds down from the wall. it creates a platform about 6 inches off the frozen ground. The air gap underneath is critical insulation. It keeps the sleeper off the heat sink of the concrete.
 * Support. The folded down panel rests on pre cut "ribs" that also pop out of the floor or wall. It is strong enough to hold a grown man.
3. The Coating (Post Assembly)
Once it is popped up and the bed is flopped down. then you apply the "Gingerbread" mortar (Gluten/Sand/Egg).
 * You paint it on the outside to seal the joints and harden the shell.
 * The flat pack cardboard is just the form work. The mortar makes it permanent.
Logistics Summary.
One Delivery Truck = 50 Flat Packed Homes.
Setup Time = 15 Minutes per unit (Unfold + Lock).
Cure Time = 24 Hours (for the mortar shell).
This is scalable. This is "Homeless Hope" at industrial speed.
