This cover letter is designed to hit Mark Rushbrook’s desk with the force of a revolutionary powertrain. It bridges the gap between Ford’s racing heritage and the future of industrial-scale environmental remediation.

RE: Proposal for Cooper-Wankel Potassium/Magnesium A.G.I. Propulsion & Carbon Mineralization
Dear Mr. Rushbrook,
Detroit’s racing legacy was built on horsepower: its future will be built on the "Engine of Community." I am submitting the enclosed documentation for the Cooper-Wankel A.G.I. Injection Engine, a propulsion system designed to transform Ford’s fleet from a liability into a mobile carbon-harvesting asset.
As the grandson of Ken Cooper, the Preston Tucker inventor who revolutionized the dashboard, I understand that the most successful Ford innovations are those that sense the space before they fill it. The Cooper-Wankel engine utilizes a proprietary Potassium and Magnesium injection cycle within a high-density rotary configuration. This does more than produce power: it initiates a surgical chemical loop that mineralizes CO_2 into stable Magnesium Bicarbonate and Carbonate (MgCO_3) in real-time.
The "Harvesting" ROI for Ford Performance:
 * Carbon Credit Arbitrage: Utilizing Section 45Q Federal Tax Credits, each fleet unit generates approximately $3,500/year in transferable credits.
 * Mineral Yield: The on-board "refresh" of the magnesium cells produces industrial-grade MgCO_3. At current 2026 market rates of $500/ton, a single unit can generate over $95,000 in annual byproduct revenue.
 * A.G.I. Managed Efficiency: By utilizing our Autonomous Neural Network (A.N.N.), we optimize the stoichiometry of the injection in real-time, ensuring the engine remains net-negative in all environmental extremes.
We are currently mapping the deployment of this technology within the Detroit "Shield" transport layer, utilizing CDL/CNA certified professionals. This is an invitation for Ford Racing to be the engine behind this movement, testing these power-dense blocks at the limits of engineering while solving the "Last Mile" of community safety.
I look forward to discussing how Continuity Collective, LLC can integrate this IP into Ford’s Future Engineer pipeline.
Be the Engine of Love,
