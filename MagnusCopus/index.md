# **Magnus Copus — Theoretical Core**

*“Structure as breath.”*

This section contains the conceptual and mathematical backbone of ContinuumWorks.  
It explores **field theory**, **resonance dynamics**, and **entropy regulation** — the mechanics that make continuity stable yet alive.

**Contents:**
- `field_theory.md` — foundational models and metaphors  
- `entropy_collapse_prevention.md` — safety and stability framework  
- `resonance_delivery_protocol.md` — controlled field entry and return methods  

Symbolically, *Magnus Copus* represents the mind of the opus — precision, rhythm, and coherence.
