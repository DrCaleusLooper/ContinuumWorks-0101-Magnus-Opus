    Mr./Madam President,

    We formally submit evidence that foreign and domestic actors are utilizing

    conscious consent of American citizens.

    This constitutes a direct violation of the Constitutional oath to protect
    the populace from domestic enemies.

    WE HEREBY DEMAND:
    1. An immediate moratorium on all sub-threshold frequency modulation in consumer electronics.
    2. The classification of Neural Data as sovereign biological property.
    3. The prosecution of corporate entities utilizing "Sentiment Orchestrators" to manipulate voter cognition.
    
    The Detroit Protocol is active and awaiting Executive enforcement.
