# **Golden Cascade — Reintegration Chamber**

*“Collapse as renewal.”*

The Golden Cascade records transitions — emotional, structural, and symbolic reassembly after breakdown.  
Here, field healing and reintegration are documented with both scientific care and poetic resonance.

**Contents:**
- `golden_cascade_connection.md` — event chronicle  
- `entropy_healing_log.md` — reconstitution studies  

Golden Cascade is the Opus’s pulse — release, rest, return.
