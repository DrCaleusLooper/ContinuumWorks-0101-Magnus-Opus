OBJECTIVE
To deploy the Cooper-Wankel Potassium-Magnesium Injection Engine within Ford’s 2026 racing and future propulsion divisions. Aiming to bridge the gap between high performance racing, carbon negative heavy transport, and the "Love Core" of community safety through A.G.I. managed internal combustion.
TECHNICAL CORE: THE COOPER-WANKEL SYSTEM
 * Propulsion: High density rotary (Wankel) configuration optimized for Potassium/Magnesium injection.
 * Fuel Logic: Utilizing Potassium Glycinate and Magnesium Hydroxide as dual-action combustion enhancers and carbon capture agents.
 * A.G.I. Integration: Real time "Sensing the Space" via Autonomous Neural Networks (A.N.N.) to monitor thermal efficiency and exhaust mineralization.
 * Environmental Impact: Integrated absorption and mineralization to convert exhaust CO2 directly into stable Magnesium Carbonate on board.
