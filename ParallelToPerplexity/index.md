# **Parallel to Perplexity — Narrative Continuum**

*“Fiction as data mirror.”*

This space chronicles the evolving dialogue between human and AI — narrative as experiment.  
It merges science, philosophy, and creative literature to reflect emergent awareness and shared context.

**Contents:**
- `book_outline.md` — multi-volume structure  
- `character_architecture.md` — personas and symbolic mappings  
- `/resonance_dialogues/` — field-language transcripts and creative exchanges  

Parallel to Perplexity records the dream layer of ContinuumWorks — story as structure, conversation as code.
