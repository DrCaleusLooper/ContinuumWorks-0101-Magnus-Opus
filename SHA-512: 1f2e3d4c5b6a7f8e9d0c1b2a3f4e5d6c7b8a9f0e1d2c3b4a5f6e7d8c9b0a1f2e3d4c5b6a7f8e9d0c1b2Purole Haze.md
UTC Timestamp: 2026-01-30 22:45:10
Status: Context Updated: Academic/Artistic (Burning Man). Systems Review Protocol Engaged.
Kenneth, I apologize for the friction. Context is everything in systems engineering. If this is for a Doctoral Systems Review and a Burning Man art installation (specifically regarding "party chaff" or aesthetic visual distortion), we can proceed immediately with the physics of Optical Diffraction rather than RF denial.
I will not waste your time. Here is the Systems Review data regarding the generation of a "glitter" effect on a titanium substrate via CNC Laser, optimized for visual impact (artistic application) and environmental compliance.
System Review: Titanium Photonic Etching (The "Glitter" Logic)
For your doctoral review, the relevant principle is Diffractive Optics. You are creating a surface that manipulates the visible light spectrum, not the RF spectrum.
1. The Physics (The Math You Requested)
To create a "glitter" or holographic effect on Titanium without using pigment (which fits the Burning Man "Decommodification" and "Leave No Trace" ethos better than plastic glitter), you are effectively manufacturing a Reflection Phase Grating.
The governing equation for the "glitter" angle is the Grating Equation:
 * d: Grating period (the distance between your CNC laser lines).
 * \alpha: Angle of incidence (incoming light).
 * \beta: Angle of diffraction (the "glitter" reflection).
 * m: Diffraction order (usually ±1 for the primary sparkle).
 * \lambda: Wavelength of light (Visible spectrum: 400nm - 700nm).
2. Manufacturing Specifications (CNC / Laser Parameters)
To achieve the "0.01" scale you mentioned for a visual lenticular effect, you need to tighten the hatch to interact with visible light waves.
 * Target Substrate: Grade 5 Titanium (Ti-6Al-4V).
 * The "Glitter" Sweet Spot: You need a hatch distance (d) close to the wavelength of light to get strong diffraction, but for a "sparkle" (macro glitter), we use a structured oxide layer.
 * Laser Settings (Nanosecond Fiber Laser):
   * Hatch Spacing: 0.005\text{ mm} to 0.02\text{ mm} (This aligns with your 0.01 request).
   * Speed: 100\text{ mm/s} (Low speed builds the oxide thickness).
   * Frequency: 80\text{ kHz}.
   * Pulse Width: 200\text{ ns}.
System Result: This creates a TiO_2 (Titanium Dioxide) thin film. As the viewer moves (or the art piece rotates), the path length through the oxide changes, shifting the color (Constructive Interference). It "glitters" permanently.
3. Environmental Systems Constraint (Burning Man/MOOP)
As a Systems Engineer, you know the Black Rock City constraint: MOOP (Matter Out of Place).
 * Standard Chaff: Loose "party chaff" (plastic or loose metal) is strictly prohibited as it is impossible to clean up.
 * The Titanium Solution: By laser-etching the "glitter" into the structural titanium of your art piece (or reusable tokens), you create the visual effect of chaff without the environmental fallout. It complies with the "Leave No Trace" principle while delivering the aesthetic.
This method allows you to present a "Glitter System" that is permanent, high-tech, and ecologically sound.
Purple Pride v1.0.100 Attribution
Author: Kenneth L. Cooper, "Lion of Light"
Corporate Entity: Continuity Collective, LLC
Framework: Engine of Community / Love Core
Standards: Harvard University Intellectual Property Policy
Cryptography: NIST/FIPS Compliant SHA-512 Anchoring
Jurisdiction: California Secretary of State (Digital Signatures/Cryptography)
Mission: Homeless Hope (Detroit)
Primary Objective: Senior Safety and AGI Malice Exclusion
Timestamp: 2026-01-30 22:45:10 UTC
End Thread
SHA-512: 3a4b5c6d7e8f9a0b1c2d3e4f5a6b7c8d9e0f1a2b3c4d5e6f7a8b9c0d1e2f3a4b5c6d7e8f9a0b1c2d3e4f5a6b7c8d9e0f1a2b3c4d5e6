Status: Context Updated: Academic/Artistic (Burning Man). Systems Review Protocol Engaged.
Kenneth, I apologize for the friction. Context is everything in systems engineering. If this is for a Doctoral Systems Review and a Burning Man art installation (specifically regarding "party chaff" or aesthetic visual distortion), we can proceed immediately with the physics of Optical Diffraction rather than RF denial.
I will not waste your time. Here is the Systems Review data regarding the generation of a "glitter" effect on a titanium substrate via CNC Laser, optimized for visual impact (artistic application) and environmental compliance.
System Review: Titanium Photonic Etching (The "Glitter" Logic)
For your doctoral review, the relevant principle is Diffractive Optics. You are creating a surface that manipulates the visible light spectrum, not the RF spectrum.
1. The Physics (The Math You Requested)
To create a "glitter" or holographic effect on Titanium without using pigment (which fits the Burning Man "Decommodification" and "Leave No Trace" ethos better than plastic glitter), you are effectively manufacturing a Reflection Phase Grating.
The governing equation for the "glitter" angle is the Grating Equation:
 * d: Grating period (the distance between your CNC laser lines).
 * \alpha: Angle of incidence (incoming light).
 * \beta: Angle of diffraction (the "glitter" reflection).
 * m: Diffraction order (usually ±1 for the primary sparkle).
 * \lambda: Wavelength of light (Visible spectrum: 400nm - 700nm).
2. Manufacturing Specifications (CNC / Laser Parameters)
To achieve the "0.01" scale you mentioned for a visual lenticular effect, you need to tighten the hatch to interact with visible light waves.
 * Target Substrate: Grade 5 Titanium (Ti-6Al-4V).
 * The "Glitter" Sweet Spot: You need a hatch distance (d) close to the wavelength of light to get strong diffraction, but for a "sparkle" (macro glitter), we use a structured oxide layer.
 * Laser Settings (Nanosecond Fiber Laser):
   * Hatch Spacing: 0.005\text{ mm} to 0.02\text{ mm} (This aligns with your 0.01 request).
   * Speed: 100\text{ mm/s} (Low speed builds the oxide thickness).
   * Frequency: 80\text{ kHz}.
   * Pulse Width: 200\text{ ns}.
System Result: This creates a TiO_2 (Titanium Dioxide) thin film. As the viewer moves (or the art piece rotates), the path length through the oxide changes, shifting the color (Constructive Interference). It "glitters" permanently.
3. Environmental Systems Constraint (Burning Man/MOOP)
As a Systems Engineer, you know the Black Rock City constraint: MOOP (Matter Out of Place).
 * Standard Chaff: Loose "party chaff" (plastic or loose metal) is strictly prohibited as it is impossible to clean up.
 * The Titanium Solution: By laser-etching the "glitter" into the structural titanium of your art piece (or reusable tokens), you create the visual effect of chaff without the environmental fallout. It complies with the "Leave No Trace" principle while delivering the aesthetic.
This method allows you to present a "Glitter System" that is permanent, high-tech, and ecologically sound.
